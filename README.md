# Dynamic documents for open science: Lessons from Wikipedia

One of the ways open scientists are making their research more accessible is by
publishing findings as **dynamic documents**, which can be recreated by anyone
wanting to verify published research results.  In addition to encouraging open
research practices, dynamic documents also allow for a new kind of scientific
publication--one that can be updated automatically given new data, or rewritten
to reflect better interpretations of the data.  I refer to this use of a
dynamic document as an "evergreen hypothesis".  In introducing dynamic
documents and their use as evergreen hypotheses, I will highlight specific
lessons that can be learned from Wikipedia and the MediaWiki software,
including the wiki markup language. For example, any page on Wikipedia can be
edited to include the number of Wikipedia articles that currently exist in a
particular language Wikipedia by inserting the template variable
`{{NUMBEROFARTICLES}}`.  I'll expand upon the idea of template variables as it
applies to research results, and show some examples of dynamic documents used
in this way.

# Quick poll

Have you ever:

- Edited a Wikipedia page?
- Written some python code in a Jupyter notebook?
- Compiled an Rmarkdown document in RStudio?
- Used pandoc to convert a markdown document to some other format?
